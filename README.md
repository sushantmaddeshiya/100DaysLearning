The Learning path is  followed by ThapaTechnical in problem-solving questions using JavaScript

# Day 1
Learn the finding longest string by using the reduce() method.
Remove white space by using the trim() method and also check if the string is empty by the if-else condition.
Use split(" ") (" " -> space is needed to separate every individual word otherwise merge all in a single array.) method to convert the string into an array to calculate the longest string in a given phrase

# Day 2
Remove the space between the words connect it add '#' at starting position and print it.

# Day 3
Converting string and the char which we have to compare into lowercase
By using the split [""-> double comma without space every char of the string converts into an array]
Comparing accuChar as the counting of the currStr(No on repeated char inside a string) to a given char.

# Day 4
Checking the Equilateral, Isosceles and Scalene

# Day 5 
Sort an array by using the sort() method and another loop method.

# Day 6
checking palindrome by using. (/\W/g) -> Use to remove spaces and non-character words.

# Day 7
Find the max-valued number in the given array.
Math.max()  method and use spread operator (...) by passing values otherwise the result will be  in NaN. example Math.max(...arr);

# Day 8
The below code has a loop-hole the factorial of 0 is "1" Let's see the second solution.
